# network.tf : Existing Shared VPC contract for managed Cloud Run egress.
#
# The network is intentionally owned by a horizontal networking stack. This application
# module verifies the selected subnet and grants only its Cloud Run service agent permission
# to discover the host network and consume that subnet. The service project must already be
# associated with the host project; keeping that association in the network owner's state
# avoids two Terraform states competing for the Shared VPC lifecycle.
