/**
 * Two small pills at the top right of every page: the model that ANSWERED, and `Search` when
 * the answer used an online search tool (owner decision, 2026-09-23; they replace the
 * full-width provenance banner).
 *
 * The pill names what answered, not what configuration would call. Until an answer arrives it
 * shows the service's configured `generator_model` from `/healthz`, dimmed, with where the
 * runtime sits in its title. From then on it shows the `X-Answered-By` header of the console's
 * last answering response, solid, and `Search` appears only while that response carried
 * `X-Search-Used: true`. Both headers are emitted by the service
 * (`install_answer_provenance` in `api/app.py`, which also names them in
 * `Access-Control-Expose-Headers` so this cross-origin console can read them).
 *
 * **Every value comes from the service**, and nothing here infers one. A UI that read its own
 * runtime from `window.location` would be right until the deployment served through a proxy,
 * and wrong silently after that.
 *
 * Health uses the same `API_BASE` as every other call this console makes, resolved once in
 * `lib/api`: `<mount>/api` under the portal, the service's own origin standalone. The
 * `connect-src` this console ships is built from that same value, so a health check on a base
 * of its own would be silently refused, and the pills would render nothing.

/**
 * Renders once the service has answered `/healthz`, and nothing before that.

 * The null-until-known state is deliberate: a pill defaulting to a model or a runtime while the
 * fetch is in flight would state a falsehood on some page load, and a failed health call renders
 * nothing for the same reason. The page's own error surface owns the failure.
