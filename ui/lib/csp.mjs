// The console's Content-Security-Policy, in one module so it is built once and read twice.
//
// Emitting it inline in `next.config.mjs` through the static `headers()` table allows exactly
// one directive: `frame-ancestors`. That is an anti-clickjacking control and
// nothing else. There was no `default-src`, no `script-src`, no `object-src` and no `base-uri`,
// so the console had no default-deny at all.
//
// The obvious repair, adding `script-src 'self'`, is worse than it looks: Next serves its
// hydration bootstrap as an INLINE script carrying the Flight payload, so `'self'` blocks it,
// `__next_f` never fills, React never attaches, and the console renders its controls as dead
// markup while the headers, the type-check, the build and every test stay green. The only
// working answer is a PER-REQUEST nonce, which a static `headers()` table cannot express.
//
// So the policy moved here, the nonce is minted per request in `proxy.ts`, and `next.config.mjs`
// no longer emits a `Content-Security-Policy` at all. Two layers both setting it would give the
// browser two policies to intersect, and the stricter one wins per directive, which would
// quietly reinstate the defect this module exists to remove.
